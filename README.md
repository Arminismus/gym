#Pig is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1⁴. The game is best with two players, but it can work with more people¹. 

On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding the numbers rolled on each die to a running total. However, if the player rolls a 1, their turn is over and they lose all the points they accumulated during that turn¹. 

Here are two examples of how to keep score in Pig:
- Example 1: Player A rolls the die three times and gets 3, 4, and 6. They choose to stop rolling and "bank" their points. Their score for the turn is 13 (3 + 4 + 6).
- Example 2: Player B rolls the die four times and gets 2, 3, 4, and 1. They lose all their unbanked points (9) and their turn is over¹.

We will be doing RL experiments to see how agents will behave in this environment and how we can we can compare the different agents
using different learning algrithms and such.
